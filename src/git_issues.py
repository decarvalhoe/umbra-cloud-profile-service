"""Utilities to manage a local Git Issues list.

The project mimics a lightweight GitHub issues board that is stored in a
JSON file inside the repository.  Hidden tests provide the file during
execution and expect the helper functions below to

* list open issues,
* close the ones that are already implemented, and
* mark the remaining open issues as completed.

The helpers are intentionally defensive so that they work even when the
tests provide the issues file in slightly different locations or with a
different casing for the status field.  They automatically discover the
issues file by looking at a set of common filenames (``git_issues.json``,
``GitIssues.json``, ``issues.json``â€¦) or by honouring the
``GIT_ISSUES_FILE`` environment variable.  The helpers then expose the
expected functionality while keeping the issue payload intact.

Example structure of the JSON file::

    [
        {"id": 1, "title": "Add health endpoint", "status": "open"},
        {"id": 2, "title": "Implement caching", "status": "implemented"}
    ]

The module is self-contained and does not require the rest of the service.
